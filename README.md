# Virtual reality based kinematics for assessment of post-stroke upper limb function
Assessment of upper limb function in individuals with stroke using virtual reality technique
# PhD project of netha.hussain@gu.se
Sixty-seven participants with moderate (32–57 points) or mild (58–65 points) stroke impairment as assessed with Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity were included from the Stroke Arm Longitudinal study at the University of Gothenburg—SALGOT cohort of non-selected individuals within the first year of stroke. The stroke groups and 43 healthy controls performed the target-to-target pointing task, where 32 circular targets appear one after the other and disappear when pointed at by the haptic handheld stylus in a three-dimensional VR environment. The kinematic parameters captured by the stylus included movement time, velocities, and smoothness of movement. This repository contains the code for calculating and analysing kinematic data.
